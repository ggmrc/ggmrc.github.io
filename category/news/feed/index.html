				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, on December 2015, the Club formally turned over the layout to Randall Museum Friends – the non-profit Friends organization of Randall Museum.</p>
<p>Randall Museum is currently closed for renovation; as it is a construction site, access to the museum is limited to the renovation team. The train room is thus currently not accessible.</p>
<p>Randall Museum will open early 2017. The railroad layout is remaining and is to be one of the featured exhibits. It is being partially automated to offer some activity whenever the museum is open to the public. A higher glass barrier is being installed to make it safe to have the layout on display whenever the museum is open.</p>
<p>From a model railroading perspective, no significant change is being made to the layout. It retains its original track plan, as listed on this site, and the automation will not affect operations.</p>
<p>After it reopens, Randall Museum looks forward figuring out how to continue participation to run trains and provide an educational and operational value. Nothing specific has been decided yet, except there is a strong desire to coordinate and figure the best way to make this happen.</p>
<p>For further questions, please contact Nathan Robinson from <a href="http://www.randallmuseum.org">Randall Museum Friends</a>.</p>

<p>Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc.<br />
P O Box 14933<br />
San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
<p>Cassandra Costello<br />
Chris Boettcher<br />
Nathan Robinson</p>
<p>Re: The Randall Museum/Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc.</p>
<p>Dear Cassandra, Chris and Nathan,</p>
<p>This letter is directed to the three of you in your respective capacities of authorized representative of the San Francisco Department of Recreation and Parks, The Randall Museum and the Randall Friends respectively.</p>
<p>After almost two years of negotiations we have been unable to reach an agreement with you regarding our Club, the Museum and continued operation of the existing model train layout that is acceptable to our Membership. It appears that we have come to an end of our 54 year relationship.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, all of us have repeatedly expressed a strong desire that the model train operation remain in the Randall and be open and operating for the public’s enjoyment. To accomplish this goal Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc. hereby gives the layout together with the tools, supplies and materials needed to maintain and repair the layout , all of which are in the train room, to the Randall Museum for the enjoyment of the public. Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc. hereby disavows any and all responsibility for maintenance, repairs, and operations as well as any changes or improvements to the layout. From this point forward any and all repairs, maintenance, changes, alterations, improvements and operations that the The Museum desires to undertake shall be in its sole discretion and solely at its own expense.</p>
<p>We request two things from the Museum:</p>
<ol>
<li>That those Club Members who desire to assist the Museum in operations, maintenance, repairs or improvements be allowed to do so and to operate their private trains on the layout; and</li>
<li>That if the Museum for any reason decides not to continue operation of the layout, that Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc. be permitted to salvage any usable items from the layout and train room for donation to other model railroad clubs.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we believe you are aware, all engines, rolling stock, vehicles, power supplies and throttles have been removed from the layout for safekeeping during the Museum’s renovation. Once the Museum re-opens and the layout is up and running Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc. will donate the stored engines, rolling stock, vehicles, power supplies and throttles to the Museum to the extent it desires to accept the items.</p>
<p>Please note that we are closing our Post Office Box and all written communications should be addressed to James R. Willcox, P O Box 1382, Ross, CA 94957. You have the email addresses for the Negiotiating Committee.</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours,</p>
<p>Golden Gate Model Railroaders, Inc.<br />
By James R Willcox<br />
Secretary/Treasurer and Chairman of the Negotiating Committee</td>

<p>Our last Junior Engineer Day was on May 16, and many children came and had a last chance to run a train with us.</p>
<p>We are planning to reopen in 2017 with the layout updated and improved.  We are working with the Museum to provide access the layout any time that the Museum is open and not just on Saturdays.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is now 2013 and the Golden Gate Model Railroad Club is eager to begin a new year with changes, updates, and improvements.  You may have noticed small changes to the layout including platform lighting at Union Station, animated house fire scene, operating crossing signals, and replacement of the trestle bridge at the peak of the mountain during the past year.  This year promises to bring more animation and layout upgrades to train operations, scenery, and visible signals.  These new additions and repairs are made possible by the GGMRC membership and public donations.  Stay tuned for updates and news!</p>
